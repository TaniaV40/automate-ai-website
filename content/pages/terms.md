## Introduction
These Terms of Service govern your use of the Series Media website and services. By engaging our services, you agree to these terms.

## Services
Series Media provides AI automation strategy, implementation, and related professional services. The scope of work, deliverables, and timelines will be set out in a written proposal or statement of work.

## Client responsibilities
- Provide timely access to information, systems, and stakeholders required for delivery.
- Review and approve deliverables within agreed timeframes.
- Use the services in compliance with applicable UK laws and regulations.

## Fees and payment
Fees are outlined in the proposal or statement of work. Unless otherwise agreed, invoices are payable within 14 days. Late payments may incur interest at the statutory rate under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998.

## Intellectual property
Pre-existing intellectual property remains the property of the original owner. Upon full payment, the client receives a licence to use the deliverables for their internal business purposes, unless otherwise stated in writing.

## Confidentiality
Both parties agree to keep confidential information secure and to use it only for the purposes of delivering the services.

## Data protection
We process personal data in accordance with UK GDPR and applicable UK data protection laws. See our Privacy Policy for details.

## Warranties and liability
We will perform services with reasonable skill and care. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Series Media is not liable for indirect or consequential losses. Our total liability is limited to the fees paid for the services in the 12 months preceding the claim.

## Termination
Either party may terminate with written notice if the other party materially breaches these terms and fails to remedy the breach within a reasonable period. Outstanding fees remain payable.
